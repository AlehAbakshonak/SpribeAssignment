- Adaptive screen. Try to draw window size while the reels are spinning;
- Migrated animations to gsap, also used simple css transitions and animations for a button;
- Optimized resize function by adding debounce;
- Optimized assets load and texture use;
- Better sprite randomization while the sprite is out of view, now it randomizes only once per leave.
